// Create an application that outputs to the console every
// draw call to P5. This number should start a zero and
// increase bye one every frame.

// No canvas size required. After playing around I found that it counts 
// on a single line instead of line by line. This layout I liked better.

function draw() {
  // This is the function that starts at zero and continues to
  // count in an infinite loop.
    let i = 0 
    console.log(i++)
  }
