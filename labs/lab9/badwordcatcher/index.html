For the purposes of this exercise, bad words are: clear, water, tires.

Create an application that:

    Takes input from a user using a simple text input field.
    Splits the string on spaces
    Loops through  the array looking for bad words in the array
        Adds 1 to a tally count when a bad word is found
    Outputs to the document
        If any bad words were found (found / not found)
        How many bad words, in total, were found
    Clears out the text field so the user can input a new string

For example, if the user input "clear water is clear", there are 3 bad words in the string.
